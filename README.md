### What is Jasto?
- Jasto hopefully will be fully **functional** city simulator with backend written in Java and frontend in *god knows what*

### Why the name?
- It's combination of czech word *"mÄ›sto"* which means *city* and the name *Java* itself (I'm not very creative when it comes to names)

---

- [ ] Build habitable buildings like familyhouses 
- [ ] Construct powerplants, factories, etc..
